I had developed a monitoring application in Python for our company's cloud infrastructure and it was running on Google Cloud App Engine.
What I did after this course is to containerize the application by creating Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend.
And, in docker compose file, I added volumes to store the data and logs of the application, and nginx proxy container to serve in front of the frontend and backend.
Now, it is up with docker compose and running on a VM.
